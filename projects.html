  Page header and navigation bar.
  Navigation bar is positioned inside of the header for semantic reasons, but
    will normally stay anchored to the top of the window, and move as the user
    scrolls.
  The header background is a large image because I like large images, despite
    the potential negative impacts on user experience.  That's why I used a
    small large image.

              A domain specific programming language designed for integration into

              only needs a couple more modules added to the standard library and
              some tests to be considered complete.  Formula Fields was written
              entirely in Ruby, and makes extensive use of

        Movie Recommendations

      <p>
              An application for recommending movies to users.  It was written for
              91.422 (Machine Learning), and was done in conjunction with
              <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~mmoscat/">Misael Moscat</a> and
              <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~mstowell/">Michael Stowell</a>.  My
              contribution to this project was Python code for extracting,
              preprocessing and matching movie titles, ratings and tags across
              several different data sources.  Collaborative filtering was then
              run on this data to produce recommendations.

      <p>
              An application written in Racket for 91.301 (Organization of
              Programming Languages).  It finds several semi-optimal paths between
              any two arbitrary Wikipedia articles.  Due to a breaking change in a
              recent version of Racket, the application is being rewritten in Rust.
