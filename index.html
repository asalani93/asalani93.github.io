  Page header and navigation bar.
  Navigation bar is positioned inside of the header for semantic reasons, but
    will normally stay anchored to the top of the window, and move as the user
    scrolls.
  The header background is a large image because I like large images, despite
    the potential negative impacts on user experience.  That's why I used a
    small large image.

        <p>
          Hi!  I'm Anthony Salani, and I'm a senior at UMass Lowell.  I'm
          currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.  My
          fields of interest are machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and
          game development.

          A lot of this site is sparse right now.  Most of the cool stuff is on
          other pages.  Click the links up top to be brought to new and exciting
          lands!
        </p>

        Footer content.  This is removed from the flow of the document, so the
        footer-spacer div is needed to fill the same space and prevent the
        footer from overlapping page content.  That wouldn't look good.
