  Page header and navigation bar.
  Navigation bar is positioned inside of the header for semantic reasons, but
    will normally stay anchored to the top of the window, and move as the user
    scrolls.
  The header background is a large image because I like large images, despite
    the potential negative impacts on user experience.  That's why I used a
    small large image.

Page content.
This will probably stay relatively blank because while it may look like one,
  this page is not actually a blog.
-->

  <div class="content">
      <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
      <p class="indented">
        This page is desgined to demonstrate and explain the usage of CSS, mainly
        in regards to styling text.  The text formatting on the other parts of this
        site is fairly basic due to the lack of any substantial content, so I
        decided to make this page specifically to show off text styling.
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
        Most of the text on this page is just to fill out the page and demonstrate
        the styling.  While the text does describe what I did, it can all be
        gleamed from just looking at the css
        <a href="/css/styles.css" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
    
      <!-- A section detailing how the menus were styled -->
    <div class="headed-block">
      <h2>
        Menus
      </h2>
          <p>
            The menus at the top of this page are done entirely through CSS.  Instead
            of using a text underline to highlight each selection when hovered over, I
            used a border on the bottom that seemed more fitting of a menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the options in the menus are also all links, so I had to do a bit
            of work to get them to not look or feel at all like default links.
          </p>
    </div>
    
      <!-- A section detailing how the links were styled -->
    <div class="headed-block">
      <h2>
        Links
      </h2>
          <p>
            For example, check out this link to the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge" target="_blank">Wikipedia
            article on Malbolge</a>.  The text is only underlined when hovered over,
            like how it was discussed in class.  They're also bolded because I think
            that looks nice.  However, there are also other links (like the headers on
            the <a href="/projects.html">projects page</a>) that don't look
            anything like regular links.  I also made the <code>:visited</code>
            pseudo-class on the links not change their color.
          </p>
    </div>
    
      <!-- A section detailing how the headers were styled -->
    <div class="headed-block">
      <h2>
        Headers
      </h2>
          <p>
            The headers at the top of each page are <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags.  The
            underline is actually just a drop shadow.  The headers on the pages for
            <a href="/assignments.html">assignments</a> and for
            <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> are just linked styled to
            look like headers because they needed to actually go somewhere.  The
            headers on this page are the exact same, but they aren't links so I just
            used <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags instead.
          </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="headed-block">
      <h2>
        Other
      </h2>
          <p>
            There's a lot of other small things that are also subtly styled using CSS.
            For example, the footer's a bit smaller and centered.  Paragraphs inside
            of headed blocks (the things on this page) get indents, as they should be
            read more like paragraphs.  The font is hopefully Helvetica, unless you
            don't have it.  In that case, it's Arial.
          </p>
    </div>
    <!--
      Footer content.  This is removed from the flow of the document, so the
      footer-spacer div is needed to fill the same space and prevent the
      footer from overlapping page content.  That wouldn't look good.
