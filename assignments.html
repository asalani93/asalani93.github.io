  Page header and navigation bar.
  Navigation bar is positioned inside of the header for semantic reasons, but
    will normally stay anchored to the top of the window, and move as the user
    scrolls.
  The header background is a large image because I like large images, despite
    the potential negative impacts on user experience.  That's why I used a
    small large image.

        <p>
          Everything here is an assignment from 91.461 (GUI Programming I).
          Assignment 1 is omitted because it consisted of installing Apache on my
          computer.

        Footer content.  This is removed from the flow of the document, so the
        footer-spacer div is needed to fill the same space and prevent the
        footer from overlapping page content.  That wouldn't look good.
